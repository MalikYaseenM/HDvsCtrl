# Presentations directory

The presentations in this repo play with reveal.js, which is cloned as a
submodule in the current directory. To create a new presentation, create
a subdirectory named something like what you want the presentation to be
known as and copy ./template.html to index.html in that directory. Then
when you open the html in a browser locally the slide deck should just work.
