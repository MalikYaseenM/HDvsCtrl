**Presymptomatic HD write up**

Defects in the Huntington gene due to excessive CAG repeats cause and increase the severity of Huntington's disease. While CAG plays a role in the severity of 

Huntington's there is still a lot of variation in the severity and onset between those afflicted with the same repeat lengths. This observation shows that other 

genetic factors must also be at play. Along with the mRNA-seq data from 29 HD and 49 control groups, We have received two brains of individuals with HD. One is

young and one is old and both were presymptomatic before their deaths. This allows us a rare chance to study HD patients before the brain has been severely 

degraded by the disease. The experiments that follow will hopefully yield insight into other genetic differences that cause HD with greater clarity than before.
