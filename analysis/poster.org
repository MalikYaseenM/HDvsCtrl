## First post
Since most of the counts__padj values are the same, ranking by that number produces an essentially random order. 
Try ranking by nominal p-value instead, as that will order the genes by the precision of the difference between conditions.

Here are the primary results I think we should put into the poster:
- poly-A BA9 HD vs C DE genes and GSEA on the list ranked by counts__beta descending
- ribo BA9 HD vs C genes and GSEA on the list ranked by counts__beta descending
- CAP HD vs C results, I know they aren't significant, but we should in some way show how the CAP gene order is related to the BA9 order. 
Maybe a Spearman correlation of the counts__betas?
- ~asymptomatic BA9 HD vs CAP HD, I think we did this over the summer, right?~ -CAP is ribo depleted BA9 is polyA
- GSEA results of the GTEx DESeq2 results, since we're really unclear as to what is going on with the Firth

When making a cutoff for significant DE genes, always use adjusted p-value (counts__padj).

When ranking genes based on p-value, use nominal p-value (counts__p).

This is because it is unlikely that there will be duplicate nominal p-values in the list, 
so the order of genes is according to the precision of the effect size.

For all GSEA results, there should be no filter based on FDR. GSEA accepts a list of all genes ranked by effect size, so counts__beta.

For CAP HD vs C, correlate CAP counts__beta with BA9 counts__beta. This will tell us if the order of the genes is preserved.
You might also possibly do a scatter plot of the counts_betas against each other to show the trend.

Let's present HDpos CAP HD vs C as we did over the summer. Then we can compare these genes to the symptomatic BA9 HD vs C. 
You will want to describe the filtering scheme you used for the CAP HD vs C samples on the poster. 
If you still have the gene set enrichment results from the summer it would be really good to compare those to the BA9 HD vs C enrichment results, 
to show concordance.
