This is where the Huntington's Disease Pipeline is located. It was created by
Filisia Agus and Diego Crespo. The project was overseen by Dr. Adam Labadorf.
The path to the info file for the samples is located in 
../HD_mRNASeq_sample_info.csv. The snakefiles were originally split into two
parts for teach purporses. One for control samples, one for HD samples. The
new snakefile which runs the entire pipeline is Huntington_Snakefile. Output for
the analysis is located in ../../samples/. Reference files for certain software
in the pipeline is located in ../reference/
