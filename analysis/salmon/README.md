This directory contains a workflow to extimate mRNA abundance for our samples
using salmon.

The salmon index to use is in:

`../reference/gencode.v25.pc_lncRNA_transcripts.salmon_quasi_index`

salmon has an argument that allows you to pass a gene annotation, for which you
can use

`../reference/gencode.v25.annotation.gtf`
