#Null Analysis
When investigating the results of the DE genes from GTEx and unusually high
number of DE genes were found. To check the validity of the data, three different
analyses were performed. The Null Analysis was performed to break the association
between brain region to see if the resulting list of DE would follow this trend.

#Sex Stratification
A sex stratification was performed to check for any confounding elements of the 
data due to gender

#Recount 
The recount analysis looked at the same data processed through the recount project
to see if the same high DE gene results were found.

All analyses showed that there was nothing particularly strange about the dataset.
